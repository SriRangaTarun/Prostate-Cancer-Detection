# Prostate-Cancer-Detection
A model based on ResNet-18 to classify biopsy scans into different Prostate Cancer groups.
In this project, I build a model based on ResNet-18 to classify biopsy scans into different Prostate Cancer groups. These groups are divided by a grading scale called **ISUP**. The score ranges from 1 to 6 (integers). The aim of my model is to predict this score based on a biopsy image.
