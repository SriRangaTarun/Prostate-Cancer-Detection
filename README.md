## Prostate Cancer Detection ðŸ”¬
A model based on ResNet-18 to classify biopsy scans into different Prostate Cancer groups.
In this project, I build a model based on ResNet-18 to classify biopsy scans into different Prostate Cancer groups. These groups are divided by a grading scale called **ISUP**. The score ranges from 1 to 6 (integers). I use PyTorch XLA and torchvision to train a model that predicts the ISUP grade based on one image. I use data from the [Prostate cANcer graDe Assessment (PANDA) Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/prostate-cancer-grade-assessment) on Kaggle.
